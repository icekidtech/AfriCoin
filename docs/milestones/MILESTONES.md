## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| End-to-end flow completion | 100% working | Pending |
| Transaction throughput | 100+ test txns | Pending |
| LLM accuracy (Swahili) | >85% intent recognition | Pending |
| API response time | <5s transactions | Pending |
| Test coverage | >80% | Pending |
| Uptime | >99% during demo | Pending |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Time overrun | High | Scope strictly to MVP; use templates |
| LLM accuracy issues | Medium | Fallback to text input; pre-train on dataset |
| Base network congestion | Medium | Use local Ganache for fallback |
| High API costs | Low | Use free tiers; monitor usage |
| Key team member unavailable | High | Pair programming; document everything |
